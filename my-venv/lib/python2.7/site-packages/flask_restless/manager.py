class APIManager(object):
    """Provides a method for creating a public ReSTful JSON API with respect
    to a given :class:`~flask.Flask` application object.

    The :class:`~flask.Flask` object can either be specified in the
    constructor, or after instantiation time by calling the
    :meth:`init_app` method.

    `app` is the :class:`~flask.Flask` object containing the user's
    Flask application.

    `session` is the :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` object in
    which changes to the database will be made.

    `flask_sqlalchemy_db` is the :class:`~flask.ext.sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy`
    object with which `app` has been registered and which contains the
    database models for which API endpoints will be created.

    If `flask_sqlalchemy_db` is not ``None``, `session` will be ignored.

    For example, to use this class with models defined in pure SQLAlchemy::

        from flask import Flask
        from flask.ext.restless import APIManager
        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        from sqlalchemy.orm.session import sessionmaker

        engine = create_engine('sqlite:////tmp/mydb.sqlite')
        Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
        mysession = Session()
        app = Flask(__name__)
        apimanager = APIManager(app, session=mysession)

    and with models defined with Flask-SQLAlchemy::

        from flask import Flask
        from flask.ext.restless import APIManager
        from flask.ext.sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

        app = Flask(__name__)
        db = SQLALchemy(app)
        apimanager = APIManager(app, flask_sqlalchemy_db=db)

    `url_prefix` is the URL prefix at which each API created by this
    instance will be accessible. For example, if this is set to
    ``'foo'``, then this method creates endpoints of the form
    ``/foo/<collection_name>`` when :meth:`create_api` is called. If the
    `url_prefix` is set in the :meth:`create_api`, the URL prefix set in
    the constructor will be ignored for that endpoint.

    `postprocessors` and `preprocessors` must be dictionaries as
    described in the section :ref:`processors`. These preprocessors and
    postprocessors will be applied to all requests to and responses from
    APIs created using this APIManager object. The preprocessors and
    postprocessors given in these keyword arguments will be prepended to
    the list of processors given for each individual model when using
    the :meth:`create_api_blueprint` method (more specifically, the
    functions listed here will be executed before any functions
    specified in the :meth:`create_api_blueprint` method). For more
    information on using preprocessors and postprocessors, see
    :ref:`processors`.

        """Creates and returns a ReSTful API interface as a blueprint, but does
        not register it on any :class:`flask.Flask` application.

        The endpoints for the API for ``model`` will be available at
        ``<url_prefix>/<collection_name>``. If `collection_name` is
        ``None``, the lowercase name of the provided model class will be
        used instead, as accessed by ``model.__table__.name``. (If any
        black magic was performed on ``model.__table__``, this will be
        reflected in the endpoint URL.) For more information, see
        :ref:`collectionname`.

        This function must be called at most once for each model for which you
        wish to create a ReSTful API. Its behavior (for now) is undefined if
        called more than once.

        This function returns the :class:`flask.Blueprint` object that handles
        the endpoints for the model. The returned :class:`~flask.Blueprint` has
        *not* been registered with the :class:`~flask.Flask` application
        object specified in the constructor of this class, so you will need
        to register it yourself to make it available on the application. If you
        don't need access to the :class:`~flask.Blueprint` object, use
        :meth:`create_api_blueprint` instead, which handles registration
        automatically.

        `name` is the name of the blueprint that will be created.

        `model` is the SQLAlchemy model class for which a ReSTful interface
        will be created.

        `app` is the :class:`Flask` object on which we expect the blueprint
        created in this method to be eventually registered. If not specified,
        the Flask application specified in the constructor of this class is
        used.

        `methods` is a list of strings specifying the HTTP methods that
        will be made available on the ReSTful API for the specified
        model.

        * If ``'GET'`` is in the list, :http:method:`get` requests will
          be allowed at endpoints for collections of resources,
          resources, to-many and to-one relations of resources, and
          particular members of a to-many relation. Furthermore,
          relationship information will be accessible. For more
          information, see :ref:`fetching`.
        * If ``'POST'`` is in the list, :http:method:`post` requests
          will be allowed at endpoints for collections of resources. For
          more information, see :ref:`creating`.
        * If ``'DELETE'`` is in the list, :http:method:`delete` requests
          will be allowed at endpoints for individual resources. For
          more information, see :ref:`deleting`.
        * If ``'PATCH'`` is in the list, :http:method:`patch` requests
          will be allowed at endpoints for individual
          resources. Replacing a to-many relationship when issuing a
          request to update a resource can be enabled by setting
          ``allow_to_many_replacement`` to ``True``.

          Furthermore, to-one relationships can be updated at
          the relationship endpoints under an individual resource via
          :http:method:`patch` requests. This also allows you to add to
          a to-many relationship via the :http:method:`post` method,
          delete from a to-many relationship via the
          :http:method:`delete` method (if
          ``allow_delete_from_to_many_relationships`` is set to
          ``True``), and replace a to-many relationship via the
          :http:method:`patch` method (if ``allow_to_many_replacement``
          is set to ``True``). For more information, see :ref:`updating`
          and :ref:`updatingrelationships`.

        The default set of methods provides a read-only interface (that is,
        only :http:method:`get` requests are allowed).

        `url_prefix` is the URL prefix at which this API will be
        accessible. For example, if this is set to ``'/foo'``, then this
        method creates endpoints of the form
        ``/foo/<collection_name>``. If not set, the default URL prefix
        specified in the constructor of this class will be used. If that
        was not set either, the default ``'/api'`` will be used.

        `collection_name` is the name of the collection specified by the
        given model class to be used in the URL for the ReSTful API
        created. If this is not specified, the lowercase name of the
        model will be used. For example, if this is set to ``'foo'``,
        then this method creates endpoints of the form ``/api/foo``,
        ``/api/foo/<id>``, etc.

        If `allow_functions` is ``True``, then :http:method:`get`
        requests to ``/api/eval/<collection_name>`` will return the
        result of evaluating SQL functions specified in the body of the
        request. For information on the request format, see
        :ref:`functionevaluation`. This is ``False`` by default.

        .. warning::

           If ``allow_functions`` is ``True``, you must not create an
           API for a model whose name is ``'eval'``.

        If `only` is not ``None``, it must be a list of columns and/or
        relationships of the specified `model`, given either as strings or as
        the attributes themselves. If it is a list, only these fields will
        appear in the resource object representation of an instance of `model`.
        In other words, `only` is a whitelist of fields. The ``id`` and
        ``type`` elements of the resource object will always be present
        regardless of the value of this argument. If `only` contains a string
        that does not name a column in `model`, it will be ignored.

        If `additional_attributes` is a list of strings, these
        attributes of the model will appear in the JSON representation
        of an instance of the model. This is useful if your model has an
        attribute that is not a SQLAlchemy column but you want it to be
        exposed. If any of the attributes does not exist on the model, a
        :exc:`AttributeError` is raised.

        If `exclude` is not ``None``, it must be a list of columns and/or
        relationships of the specified `model`, given either as strings or as
        the attributes themselves. If it is a list, all fields **except** these
        will appear in the resource object representation of an instance of
        `model`. In other words, `exclude` is a blacklist of fields. The ``id``
        and ``type`` elements of the resource object will always be present
        regardless of the value of this argument. If `exclude` contains a
        string that does not name a column in `model`, it will be ignored.

        If either `only` or `exclude` is not ``None``, exactly one of them must
        be specified; if both are not ``None``, then this function will raise a
        :exc:`IllegalArgumentError`.

        See :ref:`sparse` for more information on specifying which fields will
        be included in the resource object representation.

        `validation_exceptions` is the tuple of possible exceptions raised by
        validation of your database models. If this is specified, validation
        errors will be captured and forwarded to the client in the format
        described by the JSON API specification. For more information on how to
        use validation, see :ref:`validation`.

        `page_size` must be a positive integer that represents the default page
        size for responses that consist of a collection of resources. Requests
        made by clients may override this default by specifying ``page_size``
        as a query parameter. `max_page_size` must be a positive integer that
        represents the maximum page size that a client can request. Even if a
        client specifies that greater than `max_page_size` should be returned,
        at most `max_page_size` results will be returned. For more information,
        see :ref:`pagination`.

        `serializer` and `deserializer` are custom serialization
        functions. The former function must take a single positional
        argument representing the instance of the model to serialize and
        an additional keyword argument ``only`` representing the fields
        to include in the serialized representation of the instance, and
        must return a dictionary representation of that instance. The
        latter function must take a single argument representing the
        dictionary representation of an instance of the model and must
        return an instance of `model` that has those attributes. For
        more information, see :ref:`serialization`.

        `preprocessors` is a dictionary mapping strings to lists of
        functions. Each key represents a type of endpoint (for example,
        ``'GET_RESOURCE'`` or ``'GET_COLLECTION'``). Each value is a list of
        functions, each of which will be called before any other code is
        executed when this API receives the corresponding HTTP request. The
        functions will be called in the order given here. The `postprocessors`
        keyword argument is essentially the same, except the given functions
        are called after all other code. For more information on preprocessors
        and postprocessors, see :ref:`processors`.

        `primary_key` is a string specifying the name of the column of `model`
        to use as the primary key for the purposes of creating URLs. If the
        `model` has exactly one primary key, there is no need to provide a
        value for this. If `model` has two or more primary keys, you must
        specify which one to use. For more information, see :ref:`primarykey`.

        `includes` must be a list of strings specifying which related resources
        will be included in a compound document by default when fetching a
        resource object representation of an instance of `model`. Each element
        of `includes` is the name of a field of `model` (that is, either an
        attribute or a relationship). For more information, see
        :ref:`includes`.

        If `allow_to_many_replacement` is ``True`` and this API allows
        :http:method:`patch` requests, the server will allow two types
        of requests.  First, it allows the client to replace the entire
        collection of resources in a to-many relationship when updating
        an individual instance of the model. Second, it allows the
        client to replace the entire to-many relationship when making a
        :http:method:`patch` request to a to-many relationship endpoint.
        This is ``False`` by default. For more information, see
        :ref:`updating` and :ref:`updatingrelationships`.

        If `allow_delete_from_to_many_relationships` is ``True`` and
        this API allows :http:method:`patch` requests, the server will
        allow the client to delete resources from any to-many
        relationship of the model. This is ``False`` by default. For
        more information, see :ref:`updatingrelationships`.

        If `allow_client_generated_ids` is ``True`` and this API allows
        :http:method:`post` requests, the server will allow the client to
        specify the ID for the resource to create. JSON API recommends that
        this be a UUID. This is ``False`` by default. For more information, see
        :ref:`creating`.

        registration when the :meth:`init_app` method is invoked. In
        that case, the blueprint will be registered each time the
        :meth:`init_app` method is invoked.

        those for :meth:`create_api_blueprint`, and are passed directly

        only a single positional argument, `model`, the SQLAlchemy model
        for which to create the API. A UUID will be automatically
        generated for the blueprint name.

            manager = APIManager(app=app, session=session)

        If you want to create APIs before having access to a Flask
        application, you can call this method before calling
        :meth:`init_app`::

            session = ...  # create the SQLAlchemy session

        If you want to create an API and register it on multiple Flask

        multiple times with different `app` arguments::
